# UnboxedTest

This is a simple web application which allows users to enter an arbitrary GitHub username, 
and be presented with a best guess of the GitHub user's favourite programming language.

I have incorporated the html/css test into this, so when you click submit the 
desired design should pop up. 

To run this, use npm to start an http server and use localhost:8080.
